### Assignment 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
In this assignment you will be selecting one of the provided datasets and exploring it with Tableau Desktop. Begin by inspecting the available data without visualizing the data, and write down three hypotheses. Next, investigate each of your hypotheses by visualizing relevant variables (including derived variables, if that helps) in multiple ways. Look for correlations, clusters, outliers, or any other patterns. See if you can find evidence for or against each hypothesis. As you explore, take screen captures of plots that show the development of your analysis. Try to find something unexpected in the data. For only one of the hypotheses, describe your exploration process using the template below, noting changes and refinements you made to the visualizations as you went along, as well as what worked or didnâ€™t work during your exploration process. For the remaining two hypotheses, simply provide screen captures of the first and last visualizations you made.
Note: this assignment will be graded primarily on how thoroughly you explored the data set with various visualizations. Your first and last visualizations should be quite different. In the template, you should show a variety of plot types as well as refinement within individual plots. Use of Tableau is required. Your writing should also be clear.

# On-Time Performance of Airlines (Sep 2001)

## Hypothesis 1: The Flights were grounded immediately after 911

### 1st Attempt
![alternate text](./2016-09-03_11-05-56.png)

#### What's informative about this view: 
##### This view shows the number of text messages sent from 2005 - 2014 by region.  This view is helpful in gaining an overview of text messaging behaviors internationally over time. It shows that messages peaked in 2010 in Europe, the United States, and Latin America, and then declined from 2010 - 2014, while continuing to increase in other regions.

#### What could be improved about this view:  
##### An average might be more appropriate than total number of text messages sent to view trends. Additionally, a way to compare text messages as a relationship to smart phone market share by region or country would be helpful.



### 2nd Attempt
![alternate text](./2016-09-03_11-05-56.png)

#### What's informative about this view: 
##### This view explores smart phone market shares (by units sold) as well as the average text messages sent according to geographic region. It is helpful in highlighting areas where smart phone share has increased. 

#### What could be improved about this view:  
##### It is difficult to compare countries and regions on the map over time when using this geographic view. Additionally, filtering by region or country would help for a more targeted regional comparison. 



### 3rd view attempt, etc. as necessary ...



### Conclusion (do the data appear to support the hypothesis, or not?): 
#### These data views suggest that internationally annual text messaging is on the decline in Europe, Latin America, the U.K., and the United States, while continuing to increase in other geographic regions. There was no direct relationship shown between smart phone market share and text messaging behaviors. 

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TEMPLATE IS NEEDED FOR ONLY THE FIRST HYPOTHESIS. THE OTHER TWO ONLY NEED TO INCLUDE THE HYPOTHESIS AND THE FIRST AND LAST VIEWS CREATED (NO ADDITIONAL TEXT NEEDED).

## Hypothesis 2: Chicago O'Hare Airport is the busiest airport in US (during Sep 2011)  

------------------------------------------

## Hypothesis 3: There is negative correlation between On Time Departure Percentage and number of departure flights for airports - the more departure flights are, the more delayed flights are!
